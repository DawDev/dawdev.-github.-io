    "aboutMe": "My name is Dawid, I'm 17 and currently am going to ROC Mondriaan school, in the direction of MBO4 software development, I have been programming as a hobby for quite some time now and am pretty good at it. As for personal hobbies, programming aside, I like gaming, spend a lot of time watching youtube videos and 'semi'-educating myself (learning random stuff I'll probably never use)."
